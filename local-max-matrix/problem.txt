Local Max in Matrix bookmark_borderGiven an integer matrix C with dimensions N × N. Construct a new integer matrix D of size (N - 2) × (N - 2) such that each element D[i][j] represents the maximum value within a 3 × 3 submatrix of C, where the center of the submatrix is located at row i + 1 and column j + 1 in matrix C. We aim to identify the highest value within every continuous 3 × 3 submatrix within C. Print the resulting matrix D.

Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer N. For the next N lines, each line contains N elements separated by space.
